It's been a long time since someone came up with the idea that  I should write a blog. I said: "Ok, but what should I write about?" And the answer was: "You know ... stuff". 
So there was the great idea that should kickstart my carrier as a blogger. Not surprisingly I had not given any intention to find out what should stuff be and the whole blog writing thing got a low priority number and pushed way back down the backlog. 

So how did that happen that these lines are being written and hopefully read by someone? Two things mainly.

One of that is that I'm known among friends and people I know that I'm a home baker. I usually get a lot of requests to share my recipes and methods. And here the thing: I'm too lazy to write down croissants, bread, rolls and other recipes multiple times to multiple people and I just want to send them a link saying, here read this post, it's mine, go ahead and explore your inner baker, if you have questions I'm happy to answer.  

The second thing is that my long time plan is to create a game. I consider myself a nerd since I got my first pc and started playing AoE, Warcraft, Diablo and I fall in love with the fantasy worlds that were in some of these games, and not just in games, but in literature like Tolkien's book. Creating a game is something that the inner nerd and the software developer side of me can work together. Making fantasy content and stories is not far from me, since I'm a long-term dungeon master for my Dungeons and Dragons party. Cheers to you guys. 

So back to the subject, creating a game requires knowledge that I do not poses currently, so I need to learn it. Here comes the second reason why I'm blogging. I will share my experience learning game development. I'm hoping that for my part it will help me in the process since if I can explain something in a simple blog post format, I probably will understand better and I will also learn just by writing about stuff. (It seems, this "stuff" thing is starting to form.)

Besides baking and coding, there will be some other posts, like this one, but we can agree that this introduction is kind of mandatory to know what can you expect and I will definitely write about creating a blog because it was easy and not at the same and I can tell that story and add some memes. 

And here it is, my first blog post just became alive!

Yipeee. This was fun, I hope you dear reader enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. 

Disclaimer: If you wondered, this is my first time blogging. I have no knowledge, experience of how to do this and how to write properly. This is also the first time I write something that is more complex than my DM notes and a couple of lines for a DnD campaign starting. Wish me luck :D 

Thanks for staying till the end, have a nice day!
