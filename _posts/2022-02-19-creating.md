So the decision has been made. I will create a blog. Now what? Where should I start? 
As a first step, I asked myself what this should look like? It should be simple, clean, nothing flashy or too fancy. Sounds good, right? In the end, it's just a blog, no need for pretty UI or good UX. Cool, let's do something! 

Knowing myself, if I don't create the place to start writing, I will lose the enthusiasm and not build up the discipline to push through that.
To counter this for some unknown reason, the inner developer convinced me that I should create something from scratch. It should be easy, right? It turned out it was not as fast as I wanted to be. I did some experiments with Blazor since I know C# and I do not want to touch any front-end framework where I need to use JS. It was fun, building the site from nothing, looking into some Blazor stuff, deploying it to Azure, etc..., but at the end of the day, it was too much hustle than I wanted to be. Don't get me wrong, at some point I want something more complex than the current Github Pages solution, but for a start, which is basically a POC to decide I can do consistent blogging, something out of the box with some config is more than enough. 

After this, I started looking into a CMS solution, where I can next, next, finish myself to glory. WordPress, Gatsby, Contentful just to mention some. These are all great, but for some reason, I did not feel that any of these were for me. 
Ok, so I forget to mention that I'm a cheap person and by that, I mean super cheap. There will be a time when I'm willing to pay for hosting and support and other stuff, but at the kickstart of my blogging carrier, I want a free solution without any advertisement. 
I was aware that GitHub Pages exists, but I did not have any previous experience with it. So I googled, find the official site, docs, and it convinced me this is a good starting point since it's free, easy to add a simple, almost minimalist theme and it supports custom domains. ( Oh yeah, also forgot to mention that I bought the domain already when I decided to start this :D )

There is a nice step by step tutorial on how to make your page and if you check the repo you will see from the name that I was too lazy to even create a new one and copy-paste the 5 lines of stuff that I wrote. Shame on me or not, at this point don't care, I have the site and the next step was to follow the docs to hide that awful looking default one and setup up my custom domain. 
A whole lot of patience was needed since my domain provider was kind of slow and it took a lot of time to refresh DNS settings.

The next step was to use a theme. The default "minima" is kind of ok, so I decided to stay with this one. It will be good for a while, it looks like a blog without anything fancy. I was ready to customise. There is a doc for that as well, you can check it out on Github. 
As the first huge step, I wanted to add a nice croissant favicon. The doc even uses this as an example. Ok, so I did what the doc said, pushed waited for the magic ... 
And there was no favicon. 
Ok, no worries, maybe I missed something. Read the docs again, google, override the whole <head> section, pushed the code ... Aaaaand still nothing.

There were 2 ways before me. The light path is that I could try to run it locally, download ruby, blender, Jekyll and start debugging and find what's happening like a true Jedi.
Or join the dark side and use brute force and to even hide the history of my barbarism I could force push myself to glory.

You will see after just 2 commits (don't check the number of builds unless you want to feel the disturbance in the Force), I found the solution. I wanted to write down the whole misery of this and how I wanted to use the dark theme, because of course it needs a dark theme and was not able to set it easily so I decided to forgo it, but it would be nothing but lines and lines of complaining. 

So as an advice for anyone who wants to use this: use the documentation with care and check out open issues. Compare the doc for the release version and the latest version and try to figure out which works or not. Ofc if you run it locally you will have a faster feedback if you break something or not. 

In the end, we are here, I have a blog with an okay and minimal look, it will do the job of giving me a platform to write about "stuff", I can use my domain and pay nothing for it. At the end of the day, I'm happy with the current state of my blogging carrier, it's time to move forward and do some development and write about it. 

Thanks for staying until the end. 
See you in the next post and have a nice day.
